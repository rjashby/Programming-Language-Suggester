      <h4>You Should Learn Yourself Some JavaScript!</h4>
      <img src="img/JavaScript.jpeg" alt="JavaScript logo">
      <p>JavaScript was initially created to ‚Äúmake web pages alive‚Äù. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>

      <h4>Python is the Language for You My Friend!</h4>
      <img src="img/python.jpg" alt="Python logo">
      <p>Python is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared (favorably of course :-) ) to Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java... and it's much more fun.</p>
      <p>Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation). Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.</p>

      <h4>Looks like Swift is Right Up Your Alley!</h4>
      <img src="img/swift.jpeg" alt="Swift logo">
      <p>Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.</p>
      <p>Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience building Apple platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift even easier to read and maintain. Even better, you don't even need to type semi-colons. Inferred types make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, while modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces. To best support international languages and emoji, Strings are Unicode-correct and use a UTF-8 based encoding to optimize performance for a wide-variety of use cases. Memory is managed automatically using tight, deterministic reference counting, keeping memory usage to a minimum without the overhead of garbage collection.</p>

      <h4>C# is the Place to Be for You!</h4>
      <img src="img/csharp.jpg" alt="C sharp logo">
      <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier.</p>
      <p>C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.</p>

      <p>‚ÄúAs things are, and as fundamentally they must always be, poetry is not a career, but a mug's game. No honest poet can ever feel quite sure of the permanent value of what he has written: He may have wasted his time and messed up his life for nothing.‚Äù</p>
